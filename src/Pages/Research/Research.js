      Causal data fusion and its applications

    <div className="contentText">
      The integration of data and knowledge from several data sources is often known as data fusion. Across different research fields, data fusion is increasingly needed
      to combine information from multiple databases, so as to improve our ability to perform statistical inferences. Within this realm, 
      my works primarily concern the development of new methods to address the challenge of heterogeneity and of restricted access to individual-level data, 
      when borrowing information across different populations in evidence synthesis or health technology assessment.

      Risk of Bias in Mediation Analysis (ROBIMA)
    </div>
    <div className="contentText">
      ROBIMA is a new initiative that involves international experts in psychology, epidemiology and biostatistics, with aim to construct a consensus-based, 
      high-quality tool for evaluating methodological biases in mediation analyses. This project involves many world-leading mediation experts such as

      Methods to address (un)measured confounding
    </div>
    <div className="contentText">
      Finally, I am particularly interested in developing new methods, as well as improving current methods to address measured and unmeasured confounders.
      For instance, we are currently working on projects to combine matching and countermatching in nested case-control design, 
      to extend the difference-in-differences (DID) design to a survival outcome setting,
      or to develop alternatives when the parallel trends assumption in DID is violated.
