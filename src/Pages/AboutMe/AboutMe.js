        <div className="shortDescription">
            I am a biostatistician with research interests in developing and applying causal inference methods to understand the benefice and risks of medical interventions on human’s health. 
            Previously, I received a BSc. (Hons) in Mathematics at The Open University (UK), a Master in Comparative Effectiveness Research at University Paris Cité (France) and a Pharm.D. at Hanoi University of Pharmacy (Vietnam).<br/> <br/> 
            In 2020, I completed a PhD in Biostatistics jointly from Ghent University (Belgium) and University Paris Cité (France), under the supervision of Pr. <a href="https://www.ugent.be/dass/en/research/vansteelandt"> Stijn Vansteelandt</a> and 
            Pr. <a href="https://cress-umr1153.fr/fr/teams/methods/member-raphael-porcher-254/"> Raphael Porcher</a>. My PhD research was funded by the European Union H2020 program, within the MiRoR (Methods in Research on Research) project. 
            After three years of postdoctoral training mentored by Pr. <a href="https://statistics.wharton.upenn.edu/profile/dsmall/#overview"> Dylan S. Small</a> and Pr. <a href="https://www.med.upenn.edu/apps/faculty/index.php/g275/p8396"> Sean Hennessy</a> at
            Wharton Department of Statistics and Data Science, University of Pennsylvania (USA), I have recently joined the research group EPIDERME at University Paris XII (France) as a Junior Professor in Biostatistics.

            Research Interests
        </div>
        <div className="contentText">
            My current works primarily concern the development of novel approaches for data fusion, mediation analysis,  
            meta-analysis and heterogeneity assessment. More recently, I have been working on methods to address unmeasured confounders, 
            policy learning and indirect treatment comparisons. One important feature of my research is the application of 
            semi-parametric theory to develop flexible, data-adaptive estimation strategies for causal parameters. 
            I am also interested in the applications of causal methods to clinical questions in medicine, 
            psychology and pharmacoepidemiology.
